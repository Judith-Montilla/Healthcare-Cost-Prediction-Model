# Healthcare Cost Prediction Using Ridge and Lasso Regression

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model to predict healthcare costs using patient demographics, health metrics, and lifestyle factors. The goal is to identify key cost drivers such as smoking status, BMI, and age, and help healthcare providers and insurers optimize pricing and resource allocation. By predicting healthcare costs, this model can support preventive care planning, targeted interventions, and efficient resource management within healthcare organizations.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** Kaggle - [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Features:**
  - **Demographics:** Age, sex, and region (dummy encoded for model training).
  - **Health Metrics:** BMI, smoking status.
  - **Dependents:** Number of children.
- **Outcome:** Medical charges (target variable).

## Methodology Overview

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Converted categorical variables ('sex', 'smoker', 'region') to numeric format using one-hot encoding for the region.
- Scaled numerical features (age, BMI, children) for model training.
- Performed log transformation on medical charges to handle skewed data.
- Added interaction terms and polynomial features (e.g., Age^2, BMI^2, Age * BMI) to capture non-linear relationships between variables.

### Modeling:
- Implemented Ridge and Lasso regression models to handle multicollinearity and improve model regularization.
- Used **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters for both Ridge and Lasso models.
- Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R², and Adjusted R² scores.
- Visualized model assumptions using residual plots and Q-Q plots to assess normality and homoscedasticity.

## Model Performance

| Model              | Test RMSE         | Test R²  | Best Alpha  | Adjusted R² |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Ridge Regression    | 0.3489            | 0.8646   | 1.0         | 0.8379      |
| Lasso Regression    | 0.4616            | 0.7630   | 0.1         | N/A         |

### Feature Importance Visualization
A key aspect of the Ridge regression model is the feature importance plot, which highlights the significance of various patient demographics and lifestyle factors in predicting healthcare costs. 

- **Age**, **BMI**, and **smoking status** are the most influential factors. Age is a major driver of healthcare costs due to the higher risk of chronic conditions and the greater need for medical care as patients age. Similarly, patients with higher BMIs are prone to obesity-related health issues, significantly increasing their medical expenses.
- **Smoking status**: This feature is especially important because smokers typically incur higher medical costs due to the elevated risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and respiratory conditions.

By understanding these factors, healthcare providers can prioritize **preventive care strategies** and target high-risk groups (e.g., elderly and obese patients) to reduce future costs.

## Business Impact
The predictive insights generated by this model can help healthcare providers achieve the following:
1. **Cost reduction**: By targeting high-cost patients with **preventive care programs** (e.g., smoking cessation, weight management), healthcare providers can potentially reduce overall costs by 15-20%.
2. **Efficient pricing strategies**: Insurers can adjust premiums based on predicted healthcare costs for high-risk patients, such as smokers or individuals with high BMIs.
3. **Improved patient outcomes**: Predicting healthcare costs allows providers to identify and proactively treat patients at risk of high medical expenses, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and reduced long-term costs.

## Collaborative Experience
This model can serve as a critical tool for **cross-functional healthcare teams**, such as **financial officers** and **clinical administrators**, to make **data-driven decisions**. By using predictive analytics, administrators can **optimize budget planning** and **manage healthcare resources more effectively**. For example, healthcare organizations can predict the increased demand for medical services in regions with a higher proportion of elderly patients or high BMI cases, allowing for better staffing and resource management.

## Future Work Recommendations

- **Advanced Models**: Explore more complex models like **XGBoost** or **Gradient Boosting** to capture non-linear relationships and further improve the model's predictive power.
- **Real-Time Predictive Tools**: Implement real-time cost prediction tools within EHR systems to dynamically adjust patient care plans and budget allocations.
- **Enhanced Data Integration**: Incorporate additional health metrics such as **comorbidities** or **genetic predispositions** to make predictions even more accurate and personalized.
- **Model Interpretability**: Leverage techniques like **SHAP values** to better understand the contribution of each feature and provide explainable insights to healthcare stakeholders.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: The dataset used is publicly available and anonymized, but when applying this model in real-world settings, it’s important to ensure compliance with **HIPAA** regulations to protect patient information. 
- **Fairness**: The model has been evaluated for **biases**, particularly against age and smoking status, and all data handling aligns with ethical considerations to avoid discrimination in healthcare pricing or resource allocation.
